 ## Neural Networks in Swift
 
 Neural networks allow us to solve problems using vast amounts of data. We can _train_ a neural network by feeding it many examples, allowing it to generalize and make future predictions.
 
 In this Playground, we will:
 1. [Use a neural network to fit points](Interactive%20Fitting)
 2. [Recognize handwritten digits](Digit%20Recognition)
 3. [Draw some digits and have the network make a prediction](Custom%20Digit%20Recognition)
 
 The [last page](Gate%20Training) is optional, and shows how to construct and train a neural network.
 
 [Continue to Interactive Fitting](Interactive%20Fitting)
