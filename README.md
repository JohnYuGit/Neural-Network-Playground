# Neural Network Playground

This project uses iOS Playgrounds to display a working neural network. No external libraries are used. The [matrix](https://github.com/hetelek/Neural-Network-Playground/blob/master/Neural%20Network.playground/Sources/Matrix.swift) and [neural network](https://github.com/hetelek/Neural-Network-Playground/blob/master/Neural%20Network.playground/Sources/Network.swift) code is written in pure Swift. This playground has only been tested on an 12.9â€‘inch iPad Pro.


### Device Installation
This is how I do it, but I'm sure there is a better way:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. AirDrop the `Neural Network.playground` folder from your Mac to your device.
3. Open the received playground in the Playground application.


### Screenshots
Here is the page that predicts a drawn digit:
